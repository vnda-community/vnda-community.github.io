## Professional background

- 2014 Ph.D., University of Caen, France, with Prof. Marek P&#322;oszajczak
- 2015-17 Research Associate, Michigan State University, USA, with Prof. Witek Nazarewicz
- 2017-19 Research Associate, Michigan State University, USA, with Prof. Heiko Hergert

## Research interests

### Open quantum systems

- Nuclear physics: weakly bound and unbound nuclei
- Atomic physics: dipolar and quadrupolar anions

### Quantum many-body physics

- Emergent phenomena, interplay with continuum couplings (halos, exotic decay modes, many-body resonances, rotational motion in the continuum, etc.)
- Effective scales, new degrees of freedom

### Nuclear structure and reactions

- Spectroscopy of atomic nuclei, rotational bands, clustering
- Proton and neutron radiative capture reactions of astrophysical interest

### Quantum computing
(in development)


## Framework

### Formalism

- Non-Hermitian quantum mechanics
- Berggren basis
- Resonating group method, coupled channel formalism
- Effective field theory for the nuclear shell model (in development)

### Many-body methods

- Particle-plus-rotor in the Berggren basis
- Gamow shell model (GSM)
- Density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) for open quantum systems
- In-medium similarity renormalization group (IM-SRG) for open quantum systems (in development)

### Computing skills
